##Derive NEWMASTER.dta from running preprocessing for all EF tasks and combining all indices (PYTHON). 

NEWMASTER.dta is combined file of all EF indices. 

##Then run variable creation script to remove outliers and create variables of interest (STATA).

From this, you can create variables and remove outlier. 

For file with variables that have been created and outliers excluded see - EF_long.csv 

## Run main factor analysis (R) 
For the purposes of factor analysis sometimes RE variable is used (basically inversely coded to represent better abilities to correspond with higher scores).
 ## Three relevant scripts : One T0 EF Factor Analysis, Factor Analysis for Error and RT (from 2 separate csv files)
