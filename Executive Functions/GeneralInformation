Quick info: If you're looking to use EF data, use EF_long.csv which contains variables for each task 
   
            If you're looking to use EF FACTOR data, use NEWTHREEFACTOR_t0.csv where I = inhibition, S = shifting, M = memory 
            where increasing scores of M and I/decreasing scores of S correspond to better abilities. 


################DETAILED INFO##################

##Derive NEWMASTER.dta from running preprocessing for all EF tasks and combining all indices (PYTHON). 

NEWMASTER.dta is combined file of all EF indices. 

##Then run variable creation script to remove outliers and create variables of interest (STATA).

From this, you can create variables and remove outlier. 

For file with variables that have been created and outliers excluded see - EF_long.csv 

General imputation file: imputation_full_data_ExecutiveFunctions.R 

## Run main factor analysis (R) 
For the purposes of factor analysis sometimes RE variable is used (basically inversely coded to represent better abilities to correspond with higher scores).

 ## Three relevant scripts : One T0 EF Factor Analysis, Factor Analysis for Error and RT (from 2 separate csv files) 

FINAL DATA FILES: 
Factor data (t0/t1): 
 For RT - RTFACTOR.csv
 For error -  EF_2Factor.csv
